            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For his admirable lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in our Vniuerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he was long ſince created a Doctor in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie: and for his abilitie to rule, hee was after Conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,</hi> and immediatly tranſlated to the Dioceſſe of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and after a while from thence to <hi>London.</hi> In theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancements of his, how much hee was beholding to your Honour, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſilent, then ſay little: but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee was worthie you ſhould doe for him.</p>
                  <p>For the gifts of his <hi>Ministerie,</hi> he was a <hi>powerfull</hi> and <hi>skilfull</hi> Preacher: for the vſe of his <hi>authoritie,</hi> he was a moſt <hi>watchfull</hi> and <hi>temperate</hi> Gouernour. Was hee to <hi>ſpeake?</hi> his wordes were

                     <hi>ſententious:</hi> was hee to aduiſe?

                  <p>For his <hi>iudgement</hi> in <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> what it was, the <hi>Church</hi> can iudge: hee was a <hi>profound</hi> Preacher of the <hi>truth,</hi> a <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> enemie to all <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> and a great <hi>exhorter</hi> to all <hi>pietie</hi> &amp; <hi>godlineſſe.</hi> He halted not betwixt two opinions: hee ſpake not with thoſe Iewes, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 13.24. partly the language of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and partly the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but euery way ſhewed himſelfe a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant indeed.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>learning</hi> was good, his life bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and his <hi>death,</hi> for himſelfe, <hi>best</hi> of all. His <hi>learning</hi> was without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, his <hi>life</hi> without exception, his
<pb facs="tcp:17614:6"/> 
                     <hi>death</hi> without ſuſpition.

                     <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> a Law-giuer amongſt the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> made this one Law of ſacrificing to the gods, that they ſhould not bee preſented with many things, and thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:17614:9"/> of either ſmall or no great value. If things are to bee eſteemed rather by weight, then worth, I haue obſerued this law in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gift. I offer vnto you but three things; the firſt number of which, <hi>all</hi> can bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And I preſent vnto you but ſmall things; for what can be contained in ſo few ſheetes of paper? yet if it pleaſe you to giue theſe few ſheetes the reading, you ſhall know better how to pray, learn better how to liue, and vnderſtand better how to come to Gods table, ſo long as you ſhall either pray, liue, or receiue. And becauſe I haue concerning the firſt, Preached to you of late many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,<note place="margin">The dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Prayer.</note> I am willing at this time in way of Preface, to commend vnto you the dignitie of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>By it wee conferre and talke with God and by it we procure much good vnto man: By it we doe pierce the very cloudes, and by it we haue whatſoeuer is meete. Doe wee want any thing that is good for vs or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Prayer is the meſſenger whom wee muſt ſend towards God. Haue we receiued any ſpeciall fauour from him?

                     <note place="margin">To whom we muſt Pray.</note>Will you know now to whom wee must pray? not to a <hi>Calfe,</hi> as the Iſraelites did, nor to <hi>Baal,</hi> as his Prieſts did, nor to an <hi>Image,</hi> as Idolaters did, nor to any <hi>Saints,</hi> as our fathers did; but as we are bound to ſerue God alone, ſo are we bounden to pray to God alone; for hee alone <hi>knoweth</hi> our wants, <hi>heareth</hi> our petitions, hath <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> to helpe vs, is <hi>able</hi> to doe for vs, and is
<pb facs="tcp:17614:12"/> the alone <hi>preſent helper</hi> in the needfull time of trouble.</p>
                  <p>I will draw to an end. You haue ſeene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, the neceſsitie of this ſeruice,<note place="margin">How wee muſt Pray.</note> let mee ſhew you a litle the qualities of this ſeruice. Pray we muſt in <hi>knowledge</hi> with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in <hi>faith</hi> by beleeuing, in <hi>remorſe</hi> with feeling, in <hi>zeale</hi> without cooling, in <hi>intention</hi> without wandering, in <hi>reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> without contemning, in <hi>conſtancie</hi> without reuolting, and in <hi>loue</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging. Let our <hi>eyes</hi> be fastned, <hi>hearts</hi> fixed, <hi>knees</hi> bowed, mouthes opened, &amp; our <hi>hands</hi> lifted vp as to the King of Kings. And as <hi>Iacob</hi> would not let the Angell goe till he were bleſſed, ſo let not vs let him go till we be heard. Let not the woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> bee more earneſt with Chriſt mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, then we will be with the ſame Christ triumpha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Let neuer the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſo willingly come to <hi>Salomon,</hi> as we must willingly come vnto Christ: hee loueth most, willing and importunate ſuters. Wherefore, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abner,</hi> neuer ſee my face, vnleſſe thou bring <hi>Michal</hi> with thee; ſo I ſay vnto you, neuer look God in
<pb facs="tcp:17614:13"/> the face, vnleſſe you bring Prayer with you.</p>
                  <p>As I haue declared to you the dutie of prayer, ſo ſhould I ſpeake ſomewhat of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thankes. Many can be content to pray in troubles: but few giue thankes for deliuerance out of trouble. <hi>Multi peten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, pauci promittentes, pauciſſimi red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes,</hi> ſaith an ancient Father: there are many <hi>Petitioners,</hi> few <hi>Promiſers,</hi> moſt few <hi>thankeſgiuers.</hi> Are there not ten cleanſed? where are the nine? there is none returned to giue thankes but this one, and he is a Samaritan. If euer people vnder the cope of heauen had occaſion to praiſe God, wee are they, eſpecially for his Word and Goſpell, and for many deliuerances ſhewed to our Princes and people.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe at the end of this Treatiſe, I haue ſet downe a forme both of prayer and thankeſgiuing, I referre you to the peruſing of thoſe two platformes.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not of your patience for the length of this Preface, becauſe I deſire to leaue it as an occular Sermon, instructing you continually how to call vpon God, and
<pb facs="tcp:17614:13"/> preparing you to the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> which of many through ignorance is as much prophaned, as euer God was by ſaying the <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> in Latine, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating other <hi>Roſaries</hi> in an vnknowne language.</p>
                  <p>Now hauing ended, as you ſee, theſe questions and anſweres, I make queſtion with my ſelfe, to whom I may commend them; and becauſe for theſe ten yeares im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately paſt, I haue liued and preached amongst you, and that by the aſsignement of your Reuerend Pastor,<note place="margin">M. Doctor <hi>Montfort.</hi>
                     </note> I am bold in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to preſent them to you all. You haue, I confeſſe, known my conuerſation, been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my miniſtrie, countenanced me in my calling, maintained me in health, comforted me in ſickneſſe, and afforded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me much more kindneſſe, than can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited by this paper preſent. And ſince it pleaſeth God to diſpoſe of mee ſtill in ſuch vncertaine places, as that I could neuer yet ſay, heere muſt I reſt: I bleſſe God that euer I came vnto you, whoſe loue and larges hath bin, &amp; is amongſt many of you (for what le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer for ten yeares together can pleaſe al)
<pb facs="tcp:17614:14"/> ſuch vnto mee, as makes mee to ſay of my late exile, <hi>Perijſſem niſi perijſſem,</hi> I had beene vndone, if others had not ſought to vndoe me.</p>
                  <p>Since I came vnto you, I haue <hi>preached</hi> painfully, <hi>liued</hi> honeſtly, and <hi>ſtudied</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to do you ſeruice: with what <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> I know, with what <hi>danger</hi> you know, and with what <hi>profit</hi> God knowes. Surely this good I ſee done amongst you; you haue <hi>beautified</hi> the houſe of the <hi>liuing</hi> God; praiſe that worthy Knight, whoſe loue and labour was firſt in that worke; you haue <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged</hi> that houſe which is for the <hi>dying</hi> Saints; pray for that good King who gaue you <hi>that piece of ground;</hi> and your <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> is as the <hi>thouſands</hi> of Iſrael. Bleſſe God for thoſe trumpets of yours, who haue euer called you to ſuch holy aſſemblies. Bleſſed be that <hi>God,</hi> who thus bleſſeth you: bleſſed be <hi>you,</hi> who thus bleſſe God: and bleſſed and <hi>billeted</hi> vp be they in heauen, who thus prouide for the liuing and the dead, and withall remember their painfull Teachers.</p>
                  <p>Now though I cannot ſay to you, as <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:17614:14"/> did to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> I <hi>am yours to liue and die with you:</hi> (for no Miniſter can ſay it, who dependeth vpon voluntarie contribution) yet this I will ſay, and ſay for euer, I am yours to <hi>liue,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for you, that you may ſo <hi>know</hi> God, as you may pray to him, ſo <hi>pray</hi> to God that you may liue before him, ſo <hi>liue,</hi> that you may euer be fit to receiue his Sacrament, and ſo both fit to know, pray, liue, and receiue, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue <hi>knowen</hi> him by Chriſt, <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to him through Chriſt, <hi>liued</hi> before him in Chriſt, and <hi>receiued</hi> his fauour in the ſeales of Chriſt, you may in the end die in his faith, as you haue liued in his feare, and at the laſt day in bodies and ſoules, be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of eternall glorie. To the grace of this God I commend you, to your grace I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend theſe Treatiſes, doubting not but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you will be as readie to reade them, as you haue beene willing to heare them.

                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Chriſt</hi> wee <hi>receiue,</hi> firſt him <hi>ſelfe,</hi> which the <hi>Father,</hi> and their <hi>Spirit,</hi> to become <hi>our</hi> portion.

                  </p>
                  <p>And what doth he now receiue from vs? ſurely <hi>droſſe</hi> for <hi>gold, euil</hi> for <hi>good, ſhame</hi> for <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſorrow</hi> for <hi>ſolace,</hi> and a <hi>curſe</hi> for this <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi> For he receiues ftom vs, firſt, our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> with the <hi>puniſhment</hi> thereof made his by <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and <hi>ſuertie-ſhip.</hi> Secondly our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which hee accounts his <hi>owne,</hi> ſo long as we ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake. And this is our communion which we haue with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe we are all <hi>members</hi> of one <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> and are all <hi>baptized</hi> into one <hi>Spirit,</hi> and after do <hi>eate</hi> of one <hi>bread,</hi> there is alſo a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with all Chriſtians, <hi>one</hi> with an <hi>other?</hi> Art thou a <hi>liuing</hi> ſaint vpon earth? thou art in regard of <hi>minde</hi> of one <hi>iudgement</hi> in the grounds of pietie, <hi>affection</hi> of one <hi>heart</hi> alike affected to <hi>God, Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and euery good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> though thou waſt neuer acquainted
<pb facs="tcp:17614:101"/> with them. And in regard of the <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> like a good candle thou wilt <hi>ſpend</hi> them al to the good of others; &amp; be ready to <hi>ſerue</hi> thy brother in loue; and both by <hi>example, admonition, exhortation, conſolation</hi> &amp; <hi>prayer,</hi> to conuey all graces in thee to an other; yea not to be wanting to him in <hi>communicating</hi> thy <hi>goods.</hi> And for our <hi>communion</hi> with the <hi>dead</hi> they in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi> do pray <hi>generally</hi> for al vs, and we on <hi>earth</hi> do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our <hi>diſſolution</hi> to be with them.</p>
                  <p>But, that we may enioy this <hi>bleſſed</hi> ſocietie, we muſt <hi>walke</hi> in the light. For, <hi>if we ſay that we haue fellowſhip with him &amp; yet walke in darkneſſe, we lie: but if we walke in the light as hee is in the light, then haue wee fellowſhip one with an other</hi> 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then <hi>Chriſt</hi> in heauen, by his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> is ſo vnited to vs, &amp; <hi>we</hi> on earth, by our <hi>faith</hi> are ſo vnited to him, that without him we can do <hi>nothing,</hi> &amp; with him we are able to do <hi>al</hi> things: <hi>Of his fulneſſe we receiue grace for grace.</hi> And as by the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>ſunne</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond heauen, all things are made <hi>fruitfull</hi> heere vpon earth: ſo by the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the third heauen, all men become <hi>ſanctified</hi> in the Church; yet not by the alone <hi>inward</hi> operation of his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> without the <hi>outward</hi> vſe of the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>ſacraments.</hi> By the word <hi>alone,</hi> when the <hi>ſacraments</hi> are not admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred: and both by word and <hi>ſacraments</hi> when they are ioined together. Is the <hi>word</hi> preached? in it Chriſt <hi>ſpeaketh</hi> by his ſpitit to vs. Are the <hi>ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:17614:101"/> adminiſtred? by <hi>baptiſme</hi> we are receiued in to the <hi>communion</hi> of Gods couenant, and by the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> wee are more confirmed in the ſame. By the <hi>word</hi> God enters by <hi>one gate</hi> into vs, namely by the <hi>eare:</hi> by the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> he knocks at <hi>al</hi> the <hi>gates</hi> of our <hi>ſoule,</hi> and ſeekes entrance by euery <hi>ſenſe.</hi> Are they both conioyned? our vnion becomes more <hi>effectuall</hi> vnto vs. By the word <hi>without</hi> the ſacraments, Chriſt may come vnto vs: by the ſacraments <hi>without</hi> the word, he will not come vnto vs. <hi>Adde the word vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the element and it becomes a ſacrament.</hi> This I write againſt ſuch as thinke, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth after a <hi>farre</hi> better ſort communicate himſelfe to vs in the <hi>ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> than hee doth in the <hi>word,</hi> whereas the <hi>ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> hath all their efficacie from the <hi>word,</hi> euen the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>inſtitution,</hi> deliuered by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; vnderſtood of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Yet note that in the <hi>ſacraments</hi> Chriſt communicates himſelfe more <hi>particularly</hi> to vs then in the <hi>word.</hi> The end of both is to ioyne <hi>vs</hi> to <hi>him</hi> &amp; <hi>himſelf</hi> to vs: that we being thus <hi>one</hi> with him, might <hi>grow</hi> vp together with him, till that he at the laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>all</hi> in all of vs; hee (by this <hi>matrimoniall</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction) to <hi>loue</hi> vs as his <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> we to <hi>reuerence</hi> him as our <hi>husband</hi> and both he and we together to bee <hi>honored</hi> of God the Father in the reſurrection of the iuſt with complete glory.</p>

Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this end that as by the ſhedding of his bloud, their ſinnes, and the ſinnes of all Gods Elect were purged, and being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the couenant betweene them and God was for all eternitie confirmed: So alſo by drinking of the ſame, both they and all the Elect being more and more incorporated, may know themſelues to be confirmed and eſtabliſhed in the euerlaſting Couenant.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17614:126"/> But yet becauſe the Couenant, and the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt are diuers obiects, and the one is ordinated vnto the other, therefore for doctrine ſake I diſtinguiſh the one from the other, and ſhew what is the proper vſe of either of them.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. Of the dutie of a Chriſtian man in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord.</head>
                     <p>WHerefore I thinke and beléeue, that theſe are the duties of a Chriſtian man in the Lords Supper.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that he ſet before his eyes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Communion with God, which is none at al without Chriſt, and is to be found only in him, and that he direct all things vnto it, as vnto the laſt end.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that hee may come vnto this end, hee muſt make his beginning from the meanes which doe incurre into our ſenſes, as thoſe things which are firſt perceiued by our vnderſtanding, and are better knowne by nature, as alſo hee muſt heare the word attentiuely, and come vnto the Sacraments reuerently and diligently conſider as well,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17614:127"/> what the word ſignifieth as what the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments doe repreſent, and what is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs by the Miniſterie of them both, which is this, that Chriſt hath offered vp his bodie vnto death for vs, and ſhedde his bloud for remiſſion of ſinnes, and therefore hee hath by his bloud ſealed and confirmed in himſelfe being Mediatour the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of our euerlaſting reconciliation and peace with God. And theſe things are ſo ſignified by the Sacraments that they are alſo offered, and giuen vnto vs to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Whereby it comes to paſſe that they are truly called Signes, not only ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, but alſo exhibiting and giuing the things which they ſignifie.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I beleeue, becauſe the thinges ſignified and offered by the Signes are to be receiued by faith, and faith is the gift of God: therefore God is to be praied vnto, as hee who offereth the things by the Signes, and who commands vs to receiue them by faith. He alſo can giue and increaſe faith, whereby we are able to receiue them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I beléeue, that faith being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in vs by hearing of the Word, and increaſed by the diligent conſideration of the Sacraments through the Holy Ghoſt, it is the dutie of a Chriſtian man, while he receiueth the Externall and Viſible Signes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17614:127"/> with his hand being alſo Externall and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and eateth them with the mouth of his body, and drinketh them heare vpon Earth: together alſo to receiue with the hand and mouth of faith, and to eate and drinke the Heauenly and Inuiſible thinges, namely the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt with a faithful heart, lifted vp vnto the Heauenly Table: that hee being more and more coupled vnto Chriſt, and made fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones, may liue in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him. For I beleeue the faithfull in the Supper truly to receiue and eate, but by the Spirit and by faith, the very true bodie of Chriſt the which was crucified for vs, and ſo farre forth as it was deliuered vp for vs: and that they drinke his bloud which was ſhed for vs for the remiſſion of ſinnes: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the wordes of Chriſt doe manifeſtly, teſtifie. And that indéed the bodie is preſent and the bloud is preſent, but vnto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and vnto the inward man. For vnto the Spirit all thinges which hee receiueth by faith, are in truth preſent according to that, that Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by faith. And no diſtance of place can effect, that the thinges wee receiue by faith, ſhould bée abſent from vs: euen as the Sunne cannot be ſaid to be abſent from the eyes, of which it is perceiued.</p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:17614:128"/>
                     <p>Fiftly, I beléeue, becauſe the new coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Chriſt is eſtabliſhed by his bloud, and the Teſtament is confirmed by the death of the Teſtator: and becauſe by the bloud of the eternall couenant, wee are for euer ioyned vnto God: therefore a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man, who now by faith féeleth himſelfe to be incorporated into Ieſus Chriſt, ought alſo to beléeue that hee is confirmed in the couenant with God the Father by a bond that cannot bee broken: and therefore that all his ſinnes are forgiuen him of God, and that hee is deſtinated and aſſured to bée the Sonne of God and Heire of eternall life, without all feare to be diſherited. For theſe thinges which we on our part according to the condition of the couenant owe vnto God, namely Faith, Loue, Obedience: wee may firmely beléeue, that all thoſe things are fully by Chriſt the firſt begotten effected for vs, and imputed vnto vs. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee ought to bee certainly perſwaded, that by the aſſiſtance of Chriſt wee ſhall neuer be forſaken, but that we may in ſome part performe the ſame. And that becauſe Chriſt himſelfe hath both performed thoſe things for vs, and hath promiſed vs this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that the New Teſtament ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſure and perpetual as on Gods part, ſo alſo on our part: vntil at length we being
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17614:128"/> receiued into the full poſſeſſion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Inheritance, doe liue in perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, with the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt our God.</p>
                     <p>For there are thrée principall heads of the couenant on Gods part. The forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes, Adoption which is ioyned with a promiſe of Gods perpetual good wil, grace, protection, and at laſt the full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Heauenly Inheritance. There are alſo thrée thinges which on our part God doth require by couenant: faith in God, charitie towards our Neighbour, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life or perfect obedience. Chriſt by his perfect obedience euen vnto death, and by his owne bloud and death hath obtained for vs, both thoſe thinges which God hath promiſed, as alſo hath performed thoſe things which God by couenant required at our hand. In teſtimonie whereof he giueth vs faith whereby wee beléeue in God, and charitie whereby wee loue our Neighbour, and the Spirit of regeneration, whereby we endeuour vnto holineſſe of life, and true obedience is begun in vs. So Chriſt brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to paſſe that not only the couenant, on Gods part, but alſo on our part remaineth ſure and perpetuall. It is therefore our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that firſt by faith giuen vnto vs by Chriſt, as wee doe eate his fleſh and drinke
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17614:129"/> his bloud, ſo alſo wee beléeue our ſelues to be confirmed in the couenant with God: and therefore both our ſinnes to bee remitted, and God to be our Father, and that he will perpetually loue and protect vs: and laſtly that we ſhall bee heires of eternall life, and ſhall ariſe to glorie and life euerlaſting, and that through Chriſt with whoſe fleſh we are fed in the Supper, and we ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that we our ſelues alſo are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to the end we may bee partakers of a bleſſed reſurrection. And therefore wee ought to giue due thankes for ſo many and ſo great benefits: we ought alſo to embrace in loue our Neighbour, and eſpecially our faithfull brethren. That as wee are all one with Chriſt, ſo wee may alſo grow vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in one bodie more and more with the Church. Euen as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs by this argument that wee are all one Bodie and one Bread, becauſe we are all partakers of the ſame Bread.</p>
                     <p>With the endeuour of an holy life and and true obedience, which is alſo the gift of Chriſt, wee ought alwayes to glorifie God, and declare indéed that wee are true and liuely members of Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue intreſt to that true felicitie, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in that moſt perfect vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with God wherein hee ſhall bee all in all. Thus I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17614:129"/> concerning the dutie of a Chriſtian man in the Supper, wherein hee may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily and for his Saluation eate the Bread of the Lord and drinke of his cup.</p>

                     <p>SEeing all things are ſo as I haue before ſhewed, my opinion is, that the wordes of the Lods Supper cannot bee well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and declared without ſome trope: Firſt for the cup it is manifeſt as well by the Euangeliſts as by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Then for the Bread it is alſo manifeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where as Chriſt ſaith: This, that is, the bread which I haue broken is my bodie, the Apoſtle expounding it ſaith, The Bread which we breake is the Communion of the bodie of the Lord. Thirdly, according to the rule of Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> in his third Booke of the inſtitution of a Chriſtian man, <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. Becauſe when wee are commanded to eate the fleſh of Chriſt it yée take the word of eating properly, it ſéemes wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe an heinous déede: therefore the ſpéech of Chriſt concerning the eating of his fleſh is to be vnderſtood figuratiuely. Moreouer, becauſe if you ſhall vnderſtand the wordes without a trope, tt will follow
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17614:130"/> that the Bread of Chriſt was indéed deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp for vs, and the bloud ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſinnes. Laſtly, becauſe <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> himſelfe vpon the ſixth <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith that in the words of the Supper there is a Synecdoche, with whom in this point <hi>Bucer</hi> doth alwayes agrée. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit each word in that ſpéech, This is my bodie, bee taken in his proper ſignification, ſo that the true and eſſential bodie of Chriſt is attributed to the Bread, as indéede it is attributed, yet in the whole ſpéech there muſt néeds be ſome trope: Séeing that the bread which is giuen for vs, and was not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied cannot properly be ſaid to bee the bodie of Chriſt, which was deliuered vp for vs. So then the controuerſie is only concerning the kinde of trope, by which the Bread is called the bodie of Chriſt, I ſay that true bodie which was truly deliuered vp for vs. And I thinke this controuerſie not ſo great worth, that for it the peace of the Church bée troubled: &amp; that he that ſaith it is a Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche doth condemne him that ſaith it is a Metonymie. And contrariwiſe, he that ſaith it is a Metonymie condemneth him which ſaith it is a Synecdoche: ſo that both part agrée in this, that it is the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie of Chriſt, as the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and the Apoſtle doe plainly teach, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17614:130"/> it is ſpoken of the true bread, and ſo that the Articles of faith bee kept on both ſides in their plaine meaning, pure and vncorrupt. As that, the naturall bodie of Chriſt, is one, is finite, is humane, is in Heauen, doth no more die, is not conſumed, not broken. And yet indéed, as the Scriptures teach is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto all, is communicated, to all the faithfull, but in a myſterie and after a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall manner: Euen as the faithfull them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues doe grow vp into one bodie, and are incorporated with their head Chriſt, and with the whole Catholike Church, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Carnall, but after a Spirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And therefore as in the Sprituall and Myſticall fellowſhip with Chriſt and the Church, wicked Hypocrites haue no part, ſéeing they want faith, but are only in the outward and Viſible ſocietie: ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that thoſe Hypocrites are Partakers not of the true and naturall and truly Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, but only of the externall and outward ſignes, the which alſo are termed by the name of the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, euen by Chriſt-himſelfe. Wherefore wheras the Apoſtle ſaith, They who eate vnworthily are guiltie of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Lord, if it bee vnderſtood of the wicked (which certainly and not without a cauſe <hi>Bucer</hi> denieth) I interpret that in this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17614:131"/> ſenſe, wherein the ſame Apoſtle ſaith vnto the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> that ſome doe tread vnder foot the Son of God and account the bloud of the Teſtament a prophane thing: to wit, not becauſe they doe truely eate the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinke the bloud, but becauſe they doe it vnworthily: but rather becauſe reiecting by their vngodlineſſe the bodie and bloud; the Bread and Wine being offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they drinke and eate the Bread and Wine vnworthily.</p>
                     <p>This thing good Chriſtian aſſure thy ſelfe of, that I am not ſo wicked as to doubt of the truth of Chriſts wordes in the Supper, as ſome too impudently doe accuſe me of: neither that I diſpute of the ſimple vnderſtanding of euery word in this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> For by this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>This,</hi> that the Bread is declared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the text doth teach, <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth ſo interprete it 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. Neither this word, <hi>is,</hi> doth ſignifie any other thing, as I thinke, then to bee: and I take this word, <hi>bodie,</hi> for the true bodie of Chriſt, as Chriſt himſelfe doth interpret who addeth, which is giuen for you. And therefore there is no controuerſie among vs, whether in the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of the Supper, the Bread bee truly the bodie of Chriſt, but wee diſpute only of the manner, by which the Bread is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17614:131"/> of Chriſt. And moreouer, neither part call into queſtion, that the bread is after that manner the body of Chriſt, after which Chriſt would then haue it, &amp; will now haue it to be, for it muſt be according to his will.</p>
                     <p>And whereas in the words of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the wil of Chriſt is not expreſſed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the maner: I think it is to be gathered out of the like places, to wit, Sacramentall kinde of ſpéeches. Moreouer this foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being laid, that Chriſt then would not, and now will not, that the bread ſhould bee his body, after any of the manners of thoſe men, who take away the truth of his true humane body, or elſe doe diſagree from the analogy of faith, and ouerturne ſome arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the faith, from his ſimple meaning. So the manner of Chriſts being in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by Tranſubſtantiation is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: both becauſe neither in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme the ſubſtance of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is changed, as alſo becauſe ſtraight way, many bodies héere vpon earth ſhould bee faigned vpon Chriſt, beſides that body, which he hath in heauen: and laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſubſtance of bread, neither before, neither after the conuerſion was deliuered to death for vs, I adde moreouer, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> the ſubſtance of wine was in the belly of the Apoſtles, when
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17614:132"/> he ſaid, <hi>This is</hi> the bloud. The manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Conſubſtantiation is excluded both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither in the water of Baptiſme the bloud of Chriſt is locally included, whereby we are waſhed from our ſinnes: as alſo, becauſe this maner doth take away the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the true humane body, and doth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrically repugne with the article of the aſcention into heauen, and of the ſitting at the right hand. For, the ſame cauſes, that manner alſo is to be taken away, which is not much vnlike vnto this, which is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a real and local adherency or coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: not to ſpeake that, not one word can be read for the proofe of this, that after ſome of theſe thrée manners, Chriſt would haue the bread to be his body.</p>
                     <p>After what manner then is it probable that Chriſt would haue the bread to bee his body? Verily after this manner, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacraments, are ſaid to be that thing, whereof they are Sacraments, to wit, by a Sacramental, and ſo a Myſtical vnion. For that, which we call a Sacrament, the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians cal a Myſtery. Wherefore this ſpéech is vſuall with the Fathers, that the bread is the body of Chriſt, euen the preſent body, and that it is eaten in a myſtery. Now a myſtery is ſaid to be, when viſible things doe lead vs to the true vnderſtanding and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17614:132"/> receiuing of inuiſible things, and earthly things of heauenly things, corporall things, of ſpirituall things. In which ſenſe, the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> calleth the carnall marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> a great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe of the ſpiritual marriage which is contracted betweene Chriſt and his Church, and to which that other marriage doth leade vs. But carnall men deſtitute of the ſpirit of God, and of faith, cannot be brought by earthly things vnto heauenly things, or by the participation of thoſe earthly vnto the communion of theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly: ſeeing they cannot ſo much as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, as the Apoſtle ſaith. Which is the cauſe why I iudge and beleeue that the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, being heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpirituall things, cannot in deede and truth be receiued of wicked men, no not by the mouth of their body, which alſo was <hi>Bucers</hi> opinion. Therefore hee ſaid, that the body of Chriſt, was both preſent, and eaten of vs in the Supper, not after any worldly manner, but onely after a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and heauenly manner. The which, what is it elſe then to ſay, that it is eaten of vs by the ſpirit of Chriſt? For by Chriſt heauenly things are ioined vnto earthly things, and by him they are receiued of them.</p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:17614:133"/>
                     <p>And this is my beleefe and iudgement, for the meaning of the words of the Supper, which I will conſtantly hold till that a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a truer, and more agreeable to the Scriptures, ſhall by other men bee offered and plainely prooued unto me.</p>

                  <p>Say with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Chriſt hath redéemed me from the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal. 3.13.</hi> the Iudge is ſatiſfied, he cannot be angry.</p>
                  <p>Say, that your Sauiour maketh interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for you: for God no ſooner looks on him, but he is forthwith well pleaſed with you.</p>
                  <p>Say, that his mercy endureth for euer. I

                  <p>My Sauiour ſhall iudge me, he will not bee angry with mee, and for his ſake the Father will not be angry: for hee is that welbeloued Sonne, in whom alone hee is well pleaſed.</p>

                  <p>Doth the roote of a trée giue life vnto the branches, and cannot Chriſt (the <hi>Roote of Ieſſe</hi>) giue life vnto his branches?</p>

                  <p>Why, my deare friend, you doe beleeue

                  <p>You doe beleeue the reſurrection of your body, will you now doubt of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your body?</p>
                  <p>Haue the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles ſet down ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning ſaluation by Chriſt, that you ſhould ſay, I am not ſaued by Chriſt?</p>

                  <p>Yea, Chriſt hath ouercome that Diuell, that you might ſubdue him: ſubdued that ſtrong man, that you might conquer him: and deſcended downe to hel, that you might with him aſcend vnto heauen.

                  <p>Hee is indeede Gods Executioner; but, why, ſhould you feare the Hangman, when you haue the Kings pardon? or the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, when you haue his protection? or the Deuill, when you haue Chriſts inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion? You are ſtrong, the Word of God dwelleth in you, you haue ouercome that Euil one: <hi>1. Iohn 2.14.</hi> You haue faith: your aduerſarie would deuoure you, by it you are able to reſiſt him, <hi>1.

                  </p>
                  <p>This is a true ſaying, and worthie by all meanes to be receiued, that Ieſus Chriſt came into the World to ſaue ſinners, of whom I am chiefe. <hi>1. Tim. 1.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold the Lambe of God, that taketh away the ſinnes of the World. <hi>Iohn 1.</hi>

                  <p>I came not to call the righteous, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance. <hi>1. Matth. 11.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sonne of man came to ſéeke, and ſaue that which was loſt. <hi>Matth. 9.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Doe you now beléeue theſe ſayings? are you perſwaded that you haue faith in Chriſt?

                  <p>Beſides, you are a member of Chriſts Church, and this Church is without ſpot and wrinkle: which it could not bee, if you were yet in your ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if your iniquities were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen in Chriſt; to what end, thinke you, did he come into the World?</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, conſider what your Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme doth ſignifie; that as pollution from your bodie is waſhed by water, ſo ſinne from your ſoule is waſhed by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Haue you forgotten that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ſealeth vnto you the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, by Chriſts death?</p>
                  <p>Is the Earth full of the mercies of the Lord, and ſhal not this mercie be greater to you: then all your miſeries?</p>

                  <p>I thinke you know, that Chriſts is a Phyſitian: and to what end, but to cure the diſeaſed? and what diſeaſe more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then ſinne?</p>
                  <p>I hope you know the Goſpell of Chriſt is called the word of <hi>reconciliation,</hi> of <hi>grace, ſaluation,</hi> and of <hi>life:</hi> and that only becauſe it offers all theſe to ſinners.</p>

                  <p>To conclude, looke vpon the calling of the Preachers of the Goſpell; if they haue power to pronounce the pardon of ſinnes to penitent ſinners, Chriſt hath power to giue pardon to the ſame ſinners. Therefore bee of good comfort, your ſinnes are forgiuen you. <hi>Matth. 9.2.</hi>

                  <p>There is no cloud ſo thicke, but this Sun will diſpell it; no ſtaine ſo foule, but this Fullers ſope will waſh it out; no treaſon ſo horrible, but this King may pardon it; and no ſinne ſo great, but God for Chriſts ſake will forgiue it.</p>
                  <p>The infidelitie of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Idolatrie of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the inceſt of <hi>Lot,</hi> the adulterie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the Apoſtaſie of <hi>Peter,</hi> the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Paul</hi> were grieuous ſinnes; but God in Chriſt did remit them all.

                  <p>Applie them therefore to your ſelfe: If you owe to this creditor tenne thouſand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, if you can ſue to him for mercie, hee will forgiue them all; his Iuſtice can puniſh

                  <p>When he liued vpon Earth, he cured all ſickneſſes: now hee is in Heauen, hee can purge all ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>He hath promiſed, as a Porter, to beare our iniquities: is there any iniquitie too heauie for him?

Such men, though they cannot by faith beleeue as they ought the bodies reſurrection, yet let them be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by this naturall reaſon; What, I pray, then doth the whole world, but imitate our reſurrection daily in her elements? For wee ſee daily, that trees in winter want both leaues and fruit: and behold, ſuddenly in the ſpring time, out of a drie tree, as it were by a new reſurrection, leaues bud out, fruits ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and the whole tree is apparelled with her reuiued beautie. Let them behold the dead kernell ſet into the earth, how a tree ſprouteth out of it: and let them deuiſe if they can, where that great tree was in ſo ſmall a ſeede. Where was the bodie? where
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17614:218"/> the barke? where the branches? where the greene leaues? where that plentie of fruit? Do they not perceiue that all theſe were in the kernell, or ſeede, before it was caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground? Why then ſhould they wonder, how a little duſt, reſolued into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, ſhould, when God will, become a liuing bodie againe? ſeeing that ſo ſmall a ſeed, comming firſt out of a tree, ſhould by the power of God, become an huge tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

                     <hi>In the man Chriſt (ſaith <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi>) is the fleſh of euery one of vs; yea, our very blood, and a portion of vs. Therefore I beleeue, that where my portion reigneth, there ſhall I reigne: where mine owne blood ruleth, there do I perceiue that I ſhall rule: where my fleſh is glorified, there know I that I ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> And why then ſhall it ſéeme ſtrange vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that God is able to raiſe your body againe at the laſt day?

                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid: <hi>Such is the beautie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall righteouſneſſe, ſuch is the ioy of that eternall light, that if wee might ſtay there but for one day, euen for that time alone, wee ſhould contemne the innumerable yeares of full delights, and circumfluence of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe: <hi>Haſte, haſte to that place, where you ſhall liue for euer: for, if you ſo loue this miſerable and mutable life, where you liue with ſuch labour; and for all your run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, riding, ſweating, and ſighing, you can
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17614:221"/> hardly prouide neceſſaries for your ſelues: how much more ought you to loue eternall life? where you ſhall not labour, but enioy all ſecuritie, all felicitie, happie libertie, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie bleſſedneſſe: where we ſhal be like Angels, the righteous ſhine like ſtars: where God ſhall be all in all vnto them, who ſhal be ſeen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, loued without wearineſſe, praiſed without irkſomeneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe: <hi>This inheritance, I meane this of Chriſt, by which we become fellow heires with him, is not leſſened by the multitude of poſſeſſors, nor ſtraitned by the number of heires; but it is as great to many as to few; to euery one, as to all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe: <hi>Doe we loue riches? let vs there keepe them, where they cannot be loſt. Do we loue honor? let vs there haue it, where honor is giuen to none but the worthy. Do wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire dignitie? let vs there affect to get it, where being once gotten, we may not feare to loſe it. Do we loue life? let vs there ſeeke it, where it is not ended by death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe: <hi>Such ſhall be there the delight of beautie, that thou ſhalt euer haue it, and neuer be glutted with it; yea rather thou ſhalt euer be ſatisfied, and neuer glutted. For if I ſay, thou ſhalt not be ſatiſfied, there ſhall be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: if ſatisfied, thou maieſt feare ſatietie there, where there is neither fulneſſe nor famine.

                  <p>Againe: <hi>Behold the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is ſet to ſale: if thou wilt, thou mayeſt buy it. Thinke not much of the greatnes of the price: it is worth all that thou haſt. Look not what thou haſt, but what an one thou art. It is worth as much as thou art worth: giue thy ſelfe, and thou ſhalt haue it. Thou wilt ſay, I am euill, and perhaps he will not take mee: by giuing thy ſelfe to him, thou ſhalt become good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe: <hi>The poore widow bought as much for two mites, as either <hi>Peter</hi> did by forſaking his nets, or <hi>Zacheus</hi> by giuing halfe his goods to the poore.</hi>

                  <p>Againe: <hi>Compare we this life temporall, with that which is eternall, and it is but a death, rather than a life. For, this continuall decaying of our corrupt nature, what is it elſe but a prolixitie of death? But what tongue can expreſſe, what minde can comprehend the ioyes of heauen? to be amongſt the <hi>quire</hi> of Angels, to bee with the <hi>bleſſed</hi> ſpirits, to

                  <p>Againe: <hi>There ſhall we enioy whatſoeuer ſhall be louely: nay, can we deſire that which wee ſhall not enioy?

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe: <hi>Becauſe in the elect, in this life, there is a diuerſitie of workes, there ſhall bee without doubt, in the life to come, a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of dignities: that wherein heere one excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth another, there he may ſurpaſſe his fellow in reward: yet though all haue not the like dignitie, yet all ſhall haue one and the ſame bleſſed life.</hi>

For thy comfort therefore vnderſtand with me, that as <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was in one deſert, ſo our Sauiour Chriſt hee was in another:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17614:227"/> but as theſe two differed in their being in the world: ſo did they not accord in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wilderneſſe. <hi>Iohn</hi> was with ſome men, Chriſt with none; <hi>Iohn</hi> was with wild men, Chriſt with wild beaſts; <hi>Iohn</hi> was preaching, Chriſt praying; <hi>Iohn</hi> was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing, Chriſt fighting; <hi>Iohn</hi> was feeding, Chriſt faſting; <hi>Iohn</hi> was encountring with Diuels incarnate, Chriſt did encounter with the Prince of thoſe diuels.

We liue heere in a ſea of troubles: the ſea is the world, the waues are calamities, the Church is the ſhip, the anker is hope, the ſailes are loue, the Saints are paſſengers, the hauen is heauen, and Chriſt is our Pilot, When the ſea can continue without waues, the ſhip without toſſings, and paſſengers not be ſick vpon the water, thou ſhal the Church of God be without trials.

                  <p>We doe reade in Gods word of many kinds of temptations: <hi>God, Satan, Man,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> are ſaid to tempt. <hi>God</hi> tempteth man to trie his obedience, <hi>Satan</hi> tempteth man to make him diſobedient: <hi>men</hi> do tempt men to trie what is in them: &amp; <hi>man</hi> tempteth God, to try what is in him.

                  <p>Now of all other temptations, it pleaſeth God to ſuffer his Church to bee tempted with afflictions.

                  <p>The reaſons why God doth viſit vs thus with afflictions, are: 1 To humble vs.<note place="margin">Reaſons why God doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict his children.</note> 2 To weane vs. 3 To winow vs. 4 To preuent vs. 5 To teach vs. 6 To enlighten vs. 7 To honour vs. 8 To cure vs. 9 To crowne vs. 10 To comfort vs. 11 To protect vs. 12 To adopt vs. And laſt of all, to teach and comfort others.

                  <p>Thus a Chriſtian mans diet is more ſower then ſwéet: his phyſick is more aloes then honey: his life is more a pilgrimage then a progreſſe: and his death is more deſpiſed then honoured. This if men would

                  <p>O Lord our God, we doe here in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17614:235"/> (and bleſſed are we that we may come to thy preſence) acknowledge and confeſſe, that we are of our ſelues moſt wofull, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; curſed creatures. The corruption of our natures, the iniquities of our liues, doe generally beare witneſſe againſt vs. But more particularly wee confeſſe, that our hearts are full of infidelity: by reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we doe not (as wee ought) either depend vpon thy prouidence for the things of this life, or beleeue thy promiſes for the life to come. Doeſt thou viſit vs? wee are impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: doeſt thou denie vs our deſires in this world? we are neuer contented with our eſtate. We are full of doubt for the life to come, and full of diſtruſt for the things of this life. Wee are glued too much to this wicked world: and as though we ſaid in our hearts, there is no God, our mindes are greatly eſtranged from thee. And alas mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable wretches that we are, we delight in doing our owne wils: it is not meat and drinke to vs to doe thy will. In the pride of our hearts, we exalt our ſelues aboue thee, and our brethren, and boaſt our ſelues as though we had receiued nothing from thee. We put away from vs the euill day, and liue as though wee ſhould neuer die. Wee walke on in the hardnes of our hearts, &amp; by reaſon of the abundance of vaine-glory, we

                  <p>And as for our liues they abound with actuall tranſgreſſion againſt euery one of thy ten Commandements; hauing broken the ſame ten thouſand tims. We Lord haue liued in contempt of thy prouidence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting idolatry with thy creatures, taking thy glorious name in vaine, and profaning of thy moſt holy Sabbaths. We, euen we, who ſhould haue been vpright, haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded our betters, but enuied our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, defiled our ſoules with vnchaſte deſires, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to be rich by vnlawfull meanes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced our neighbours, and longed after that which was none of ours. Wee haue heard thy word, O Lord; but we haue not beleeued it: we haue known the word, but haue not practiſed it. Wee haue come to thine houſe without reuerence, approched to thy Table without repentance, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed many ſins without remorſe. Doe we any good? wee pleaſe our ſelues too much:
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17614:236"/> Doe we any euil? we feare thée too little: we are wearie of praying, when we talke with thée: we are careleſſe in hearing, when thou ſpeakeſt to vs. If we reade thy Sacred and Holy Word, it is not ſwéete vnto vs as the hony combe, but wee delight more euen in vngodly bookes. Yea O Lord, the pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our bellies, the pride of our apparel, the negligence in our calling, the miſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our time, our vaine conference at table, our wandring eyes, our wanton luſts, our ambitious minds, our couetous deſires our vngodly ſpéeches, our laſciuious eares, our cenſuring of our brethren, our ſinne in recreations, our vnwillingneſſe to labour, our vnfaithfulneſſe in life, our forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of death, and our abuſe of thy mercies, eſpecially in Chriſt, doe teſtifie againſt vs, that wée haue ſinned againſt Heauen and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and are no more worthie to be called thy children. Are wee aſhamed at this, and reclaimed from it? no Lord, wee are not aſhamed, but howſoeuer it hath pleaſed thee to vſe many meanes, as partly by thy Word, and partly by thy Spirit: and partly by thy mercies, &amp; partly by thy iudgments, to the end we might bee reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from our crooked wayes; yet we haue contemned thy Word, the Miniſterie of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17614:236"/> greiued thy ſpirit, the earneſt of our inheritance, abuſed thy mercies, the pledges of thy loue, and forgotten thy iudgments, the meſſengers of thy wrath. Enter not into iudgement with vs thy ſeruants, O Lord, for then ſhall no fleſh liuing bee iuſtified in thy ſight. Be mercifull vnto vs in forgiuing ſinnes paſt, and be gracious vnto vs in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting ſinnes to come. Correct vs O Lord but with mercie, not in thy iudgement: for then ſhall we be conſumed, and brought to nought.

Teach vs. O Lord, thy way, &amp; we ſhal walk in thy truth: O knit our hearts vnto thée, that we may feare thy Name. And becauſe, through corruption in our hearts, and ſinne in our liues, our faith is féeble, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ſmall; wée doe humbly beſéech thée, to ſtrengthen our faith, by the daily medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and particular application of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull promiſes, made vnto vs in thy Sonne Chriſt, that neither in the dangers of this world, nor in the troubles of conſcience, nor in the houre of death we may fall from thée. Gracious Father, expell out of our hearts al carnal confidence, the vnderminer of our faith; &amp; teach vs in the ſpirit of true humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to denie our ſelues, and to relie only vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thée, and the merit of Chriſt in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our ſaluation. And becauſe it is not enough to come vnto thée by prayer, and to ſue vnto thée for pardon, but all that are in Chriſt muſt be new creatures: therefore we call vpon thée, for the ſpirit of regeneration: mortifie therby the corruptions of our fleſh; &amp; quicken vs thereby in the inner man. By the power of Chriſts death let vs die vnto ſinne; and by the power of his reſurrection, let vs riſe to righteouſneſſe, and newnes of

Teach vs to feare thée continually whereſoeuer wee are, to neglect all things in regard of Chriſt, to loue thée and our brethren for thy ſake, to be zealous of thy glorie, to bée grieued at our owne, and others ſinnes, and ioyfull when we can, pleaſe thée. Let our bodies, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſinne, be euer hereafter clenſed by thy ſpirit, that they may bee temples for that ſpirit to dwell in: keepe our eyes from beholding vanitie, our eares from hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to variety, our mouthes from ſpeaking blaſphemie, our hands from committing of iniquitie, and our bodies from the action of adulterie. Let our light ſo ſhine before men, that they ſéeing our good workes may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thee our heauenly Father.

                  <p>Thou O my Sauiour haſt died for my ſinnes: let the power of thy death make me die vnto ſin, eſpecially to my beloued ſins, and ſuch as I can hardly get the maſtery of.

                  <p>Thou haſt redéemed me, ſuffer me not to be in ſinnes captiuitie: thou haſt triumphed ouer Satan for me, ſuffer mee not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his tyrannie. Thou haſt couered mee with the robes of righteouſneſſe, teach mee to caſt off the rags of iniquitie. Thou haſt waſhed me, and I am cleane: kéepe me that I return not with the ſwine to my wallow. Thou haſt begun thy good work in me: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the worke that thou haſt begun, and ſtrengthen mee in the workes which I doe, haue or ſhall take in hand.</p>
                  <p>Kéepe mée good Lord in my old age, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake mee not when I am gray-headed. And when it ſhall pleaſe thée to caſt me vpon my

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lmightie Lord God, Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and in him our moſt gracious and mercifull Father, many are thy mercies towards vs: and that our ſoules know right well. And as we cannot be ignorant of them, vnleſſe wee bee ſenſeleſſe: ſo, we may not be forgetfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we be thankleſſe. By thée our lot is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into a good ſoile; and by thée wée haue a goodly inheritance; by thée are our bodies deliuered from ſickneſſe, and by thée are our ſoules deliuered from ſinne; by thée our names are not a reproch vnto our enemies; and by thée our eſtates are not a prey vnto the Idolatrous. Thou, euen thou haſt done great things in our land, and thy right hand amongſt vs hath brought mightie things to paſſe. What is it, O Lord, that thou haſt not done vnto this vine of thine Engliſh <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi> and what couldeſt thou doe more for it then thou haſt? Thou haſt planted it by thy hand, placed it in thy vineyard, hedged it by thy prouidence, garded it by thine Angels, watred it by thy Spirit, pruned it by thy
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:17614:279"/> rods, ſupported it by thy power, committed it to thy huſbandmen, beautified it by thy mercies, and fructified it by thine abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, not of ſowre, but ſwéete grapes. The wilde Boare of the woods can neuer roote it vp, the beaſts of the forreſt ſhall neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure it. Lord continue ſtil to viſit this vine, which without thy viſitation, muſt be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and ſtrengthleſſe. Thou haſt caſt out the heathen, and planted vs in: thou haſt ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our enemies, and made vs the mirror of the whole world: Thou haſt giuen vs thy Sonne to be our Sauiour; thy word to bee our inſtructor; thy Spirit, to be our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier; thy Preachers to be our monitors, thy Sacraments to be our ſeales, and Kings to be our nurſing Fathers,<note place="margin">1588. Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth. K. Iames. 1603.</note> and Quéenes to be our nurſing Mothers. When our enemies came againſt vs, thou ſubduedſt them; when our light was extinguiſhed, thou diddeſt ſet vp a greater; when the Plague was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, thou calmedſt it; and when our Countrie was to bee betraied, then waſt our deliuerer. What ſhall wee ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto thée for all theſe fauours? or what can we render for all theſe mercies? O our ſoules praiſe the Lord: and all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs, praiſe his holie Name. O our ſoules praiſe the Lord; and let vs neuer forget his benefits. We, Lord, had béene blowen vp
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:17614:279"/> with the powder of rebellion, had not the power of thy prouidence watched ouer vs. We therefore, our Princes, Nobles, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, Commons, our Wiues, Children, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and all, are heere before thy Maieſtie this day, &amp; now render vnto thée (for more we cannot, and more thou deſireſt not) the ſacrifice of praiſe, the calues of our lips, for this wonderfull deliuerance, ſhewed vnto our gracious King and Countrie. Lord teach vs thereby to bee thankfull vnto thée, obedient to our Gouernours, frequent in prayer, feruent in the ſpirit, and zealous in good workes, leſt a worſe thing hereafter happen vnto vs. Make vs to deteſt Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the poyſon of Authoritie; Ieſuites, the bellowes of ſedition; Papiſts, the plotters of rebellion, &amp; to thinke better of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Brethren, &amp; this, not new, but moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ours, by which we are taught pietie to God, loyaltie to Gouernors, peace to the Church, reuerence of ſuperiority, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to our inferiours, amitie to our equals, loue to our enemies, patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in tribulation, thankfulneſſe in proſperitie, faithfulneſſe in our calling, and honeſtie to all. And ſéeing of late thou haſt deliuered our backes from whipping, our libertie from ſeruing, our ſoules from dying, our country from conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, &amp; our King and State from a ſudden
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:17614:280"/> blowing vp; Lord, wee pray thée, that the meditation of this mercy may neuer depart out of our mindes, but that wée may bee thankfull vnto thée, for mercies receiued, and feareful of thée, for iudgements eſcaped. Teach vs to pray vnto thée alone, who canſt heare and grant our requeſts, to kéepe our Countrey from inuaſion, our Church from diſſenſion, our houſes from infection, our State from alteration, and people from the cruell mercies of the Italian Popedome, whoſe faith is fancie, whoſe force is fraud, whoſe truſt is treaſon, whoſe obedience is hypocriſie, whoſe lawes are traditions, whoſe pardoners are Prieſts, whoſe ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is the Pope, whoſe god is an idoll, whoſe ſeruice is ceremonies, whoſe glorie is their ſhame, and whoſe end is damnation, except they repent. Let the Sunne of the Goſpell be neuer eclipſed, the light of thine Iſrael neuer bee extinguiſhed, the hope of our happineſſe neuer be ſubuerted, nor the branches of our vine euer cut off. Thus we thy people, and ſhéepe of thy paſture, ſhall haue iuſt occaſion to prayſe thy great Name, in the face of thy Congregation, from this time forth for euermore. Lord kéepe in our King the ſpirit of Maieſtie, in our Quéene the ſpirit of Chaſtitie, in our Prince the ſpirit of Pietie, in our Nobles
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:17614:280"/> the ſpirit of loyaltie, in our Counſellers the ſpirit of Prudencie, in our Clergie the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vigilancie, and in vs all, the ſpirit of Fidelitie. And as for ſuch as wiſh euill to this <hi>Sion</hi> of ours, the Honor of thy Name, the Palace of thy pleaſure, the Place of thy protection, and the wonder of the world, if they belong to thée, giue them hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and to returne to vs: if not, or euer their pots be hot with thornes, let indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vexe them, as a thing that is rawe. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo let all thine enemies periſh, O Lord. And, vnleſſe their Children be better than the Parents, as the Prophet prayeth, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them vp to famine, let them drop by the force of the ſword, let their wiues be robbed of their children, and be widowes, and let their huſbands bee put to death: let their confederate yong men be ſlain by the ſword, let them be ouerthrowne in the day of thine anger, and let none be left to make lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for them, and to ſay, O my brother, O my ſiſter. Lord roote all Cananites out of this land of the liuing, that ſuch as feare thée may dwell ſafely. Bleſſed be the Lord God of our ſaluation, for euer and euer, and let all the people ſay <hi>Amen Amen.</hi>
